This enigma-simulator project is an educational tool which simulates the
workings of an [Enigma machine][wiki-enigma], the Germans' main military
encryption tool during [World War II][wiki-ww2]. The software allows users to
encrypt and decrypt messages. Additionally, the simulation includes a
step-by-step guide that teaches users how to recover Enigma keys.
