    "## How to break an Enigma machine like Rejewski\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of cracking an Engima machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, here's what you need to know: \n",
    "  - You will be working with the 3 rotor Wehrmacht Enigma machine. Read more about it [here](http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm). You will only consider rotors I, II, and III for the purposes of this exercise. \n",
    "  - The dictionary of cycle lengths has already been generated for you. You will access it later. \n",
    "  - There's a little bit of historical anachronism in the scenario described, since Rejewski's method of cracking Enigma was developed long before Bletchley Park existed, and codebreakers at Bletchley Park used more advanced methods than did Rejewski. Just roll with it. "

    "### The Scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's midnight at Bletchley, the middle of your nighttime shift. The past days of German army traffic you decrypted have hinted at some major events to come today. Since the new day just started, you know that the German army Enigma operators have just switched over to a new day key, rendering the previous day's work decrypting their traffic effectively useless. Given the rumors swirling about a potential German attack today, you know you need to crack this new day key as soon as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly after midnight, freshly encrypted German messages begin piling up on your desk, demanding your attention. You know what to do. Let's get cracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "You have at your hands the following materials: \n",
    "- A huge set of German messages encrypted with the unknown day key (which includes the rotor key, plugboard settings, and rotor order). They are stored in the file 'message_key_encrypts.pickle'. For your conveniences, only the first 6 letters from each of these encrypts (the twice-enciphered message key) have been kept. \n",
    "- A dictionary of all the different chain lengths generated by every possible rotor key and order combination. \n",
    "- A small test set of messages encrypted with the day key. When you decrypt these properly, you will see English text and will have confirmation that you have correctly guessed the day key. \n",
    "- Also you have a computer. You can certainly do parts of this exercise manually, but please please feel free to write some code to supplement your work. After all, breaking Enigma took Rejewski over a year. You have an hour and a half. "
